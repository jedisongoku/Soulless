	//DWARF WARRIOR 2.0 ASSET
	
	//First of all, thanks for purchasing this asset! I hope it fits perfectly in your project.
	
	/*The package consists of:
	
	***Two versions (prefabs) of the model, one of them appropriate for console and PC games (13 k tris, 2048 textures and facial animation)
	   and a mobile friendly version of the model (1.6 k tris, 512 textures, no facial animation and more economic about performance).
	   
	***Each of this versions has two different models (prefabs too). One of them whith a skeleton animated by me, with all the animations displayed in the animation doc,
	   and another model with an humanoid skeleton type, ready to be easily animated with mecanim.   
	 
	***The mecanim ready models dont have cloaks, because I dont know how to create extra bones for it in the Unity humanoid skeleton. I will investigate about 
	   it for future characters. However, it is easy to include the cloak, but if it is not animated, it could look rigid in some animations.
	 
	***I have incluided a few extra animations so that the model can grip and fight with two weapons at once. 
	
	***The mobile friendly versions (1.6 tris) also have 6 color skins.
	
	***PC-console model (13k tris) uses three materials: Body material, Armor material, and cloak material.
	
	***Mobile friendly model (1.6 k tris) uses only two materials: body material and armor material (armor material for the cloak too). 
	
	***To assign purchased or downloaded animations from the Asset Store, or use your own, just create a new animator controller, drag the 
	   animations you like, configure the transitions between them, and assign this animation controller to the mecanim ready model (prefab). 
	
	***I have also incluided two extra weapons that I had in a drawer.
	
	***There are two animated bones in the meshes folder named weapon die bones, I used to show the weapons falling to the ground when the character dies in the test scene, 
	   but there are not incluided in the prefabs. You can use it if you find useful.
